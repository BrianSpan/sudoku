# Sudoku solver with optional visual backtracking

### Part of a portfolio of Python projects developed by Brian Spangler

Demonstration of Python and brute-force backtracking recursion  
- Usage of program-wide variable to toggle whether displayed  
- Demonstration of limitation of using 1D array instead of traditional 2D  
  
- Read sample board  
- Continuously use recursion to find unfilled square  
- Optionally display progress on Pygame screen  

### Features:  
Recursive backtracking algorithm  
1D array instead of the traditional 2D array  
Pygame visualization that can be toggled  
Efficient cell checking for completeness  

Constant DISPLAYPROGRESS can be set to True or False to toggle whether displayed in Pygame

### Future upgrades:  
This is just a demonstration of solving a sample sudoku so one puzzle is hardcoded in with options to uncomment others.  
Future improvements could include the possibility to load a puzzle.   

### Requirements:  
Python 3.7+  
Pygame (if DISPLAYPROGRESS is True)
